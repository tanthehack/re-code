- [x] Make sure user can't reauthorize if code is stored, conditionally render gitauth
- [ ] Make api slices for get all repos, get specific repo, send repo_id, send code(manual)
- [ ] Make sure user can only get repos with javascript files parsed (check for the logic in the backend)
- [ ] Fix the logout function, protect the import repo routes to redirect to auth if no id/token.
